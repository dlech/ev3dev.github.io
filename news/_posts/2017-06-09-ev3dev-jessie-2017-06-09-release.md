title: "Announcing ev3dev-jessie-2017-06-09 Release"
---

This is a stable maintenance release. We've pulled in the updates and security
fixes from [Debian 8.8](https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20170506) and the
most recent ev3dev kernel.

We've added the `usb-modeswitch` package needed by some Wi-Fi dongles and
the `gir1.2-ev3devkit-0.4` package in case you want to try out using
[Ev3devKit](http://docs.ev3dev.org/projects/ev3devkit/en/ev3dev-jessie/vala-api/ev3devkit/EV3devKit.html)
with python.
