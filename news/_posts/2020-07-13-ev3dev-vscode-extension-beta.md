We are working on the next release of the [ev3dev-browser VS Code Extension][1]
and we need testers! This version mostly contains bug fixes. It should do a
better job detecting ev3dev devices. It also fixes a bug where subprocesses
on the EV3 are not stopped when clicking the red stop button in VS Code.

There is also one new feature courtesy of @WasabiFan. The `ev3dev` debugger is
now registered as a default handler for Python files, so now it is possible to
download and run a Python script without having to create a `launch.json` file.
Just open your file and press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd>
+<kbd>Return ↩</kbd> on Mac.


### Getting the Beta Version

The beta version is not available on the VS Code Marketplace. Instead download
the `.vsix` file from the [GitHub Releases][2] page. Then [install it in VS
Code][3].

The ev3dev VS Code extension is also now available via [open-vsx.org][4] for
those that use other VS Code-compatible editors like VSCodium and Eclipse Theia.
